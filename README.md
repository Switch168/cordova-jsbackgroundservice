# Javascript Background Service Plugin

Plugin to run javascript code as android background services.

The background service load a whole page and needs a (hidden) window to do that, so the plugin requires [SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW) permission to work.

## Supported Platforms
Android only. (Tested on Lollipop).

## License
